# Work Samples

This is where I'll share samples of my work. I'll definitely include Markdown pages and links to my STC articles and my tutorial. I'll probably include a PDF. Some of the content will come from my old [Wix site](https://carriemmacfarlane.wixsite.com/portfolio).

This is my **first Docusaurus document**!

# Intro
It's written in Markdown.

# Comparisons

Is Markdown better than the WYSIWIG editor in WordPress? Let's find out.

## Tables

Here's a table. We can't create tables in the WYSIWIG editor in WordPress.

| Tool    | Tables | Image in List | Callouts| TOC
| ------ | ------ | ------------- | ------- | ---
| Markdown  | Yes    | Yes | Yes | Small and readable
| WYSIWIG | No     | No | No | Unwieldy

## Ordered Lists

Here's an ordered list with an image. In the WYSIWIG editor in WordPress, it's nearly impossible to include images in ordered lists.

1. Do this.

You can do this and that and the other thing.
