# Quick Reference

As a librarian, I taught college students how to search the PsycINFO database. Before the students met with me, they completed an online exercise that introduced the tools they would need to use for their first research assignment. When the students arrived in the classroom, this quick reference guide reminded them of what they had learned in the assignment.
