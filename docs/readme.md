# README

I contribute to the [Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/), an international community of documentation enthusiasts who meet weekly to build best practice templates and instructions for documenting open source software. I collaborated with a teammate to create this README. It was my first real experience with Markdown and GitLab.
