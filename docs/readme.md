# README

This README was my first significant experience with Markdown and GitLab. I created it in collaboration with a teammate in the [Good Docs Project](https://thegooddocsproject.dev/). The Good Docs Project is an international community of documentation enthusiasts who meet weekly to build best practice templates and instructions for documenting open source software.
