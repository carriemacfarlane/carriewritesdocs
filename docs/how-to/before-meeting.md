# Before The Meeting

The ZA and the Zoom Host prepare for the meeting at least one week in advance, and they arrive at City Hall early on the day of the meeting.

1. The ZA sends meeting documents (agenda, application materials, draft meeting minutes, etc.) to all DRB members.
2. The Zoom Host saves meeting documents to a USB drive and brings the USB drive to the meeting.
3. The ZA and the Zoom Host arrive at City Hall twenty minutes before the meeting.
