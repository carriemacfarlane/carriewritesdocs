    "description": "I created this how-to guide for members of the Vergennes Development Review Board. Because any board member might need to run a meeting without notice, I separated the content into chunks that are easy to find and scan. The original guide was a printed PDF. I recreated it here using the Docusaurus tutorial layout."}}
