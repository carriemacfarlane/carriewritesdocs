    "description": "I was a member of the Vergennes Development Review Board (DRB) for 4 years. When DRB meetings went online due to COVID, I managed the online components, and I documented our procedure in a how-to guide. Because any DRB officer might need to run some aspect of the meeting if another officer was absent, I included instructions even for routine tasks, and I separated the content into chunks that were easy to identify and scan. The how-to guide that the DRB used was a printed PDF. I've recreated it here in Docusaurus. I really like the tutorial layout!"}}
