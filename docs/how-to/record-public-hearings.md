# Record Public Hearings

Public hearings must be recorded and saved. The Zoom Host records the meetings and shares the recordings with the ZA. The ZA then saves the recordings to a City-owned computer.

## Record 

1. Select **Record** before the Chair reads the warning for a public hearing.

    :::note NOTE:
    If you don’t see **Record**, select **More**, then select **Record**.
    :::

1. Select **Record to the cloud**.

1. Check for an on-screen confirmation that the hearing is being recorded. If you don’t see an on-screen confirmation, select **Record to the cloud** again.

1. Stop the recording between hearings.

    :::note NOTE:  
    Do not pause the recording between hearings. Each hearing is recorded separately so that it can be stored separately later.
    :::

## Transfer to Google Drive

1. After the hearing, log in to the ZA's Zoom account and download the recordings. 
    :::note NOTE:
    Zoom sometimes requires a passcode. The passcode is sent to the Zoning Administrator’s email account, so schedule a time to log in when the Zoning Administrator is available to provide the code via text message or phone.
    :::

1. Temporarily store the recordings in a personal Google Drive account. Use these naming conventions so that the recordings will be easy to identify later:
    * folder name:  YYYY-MM-DD
    * file names: DRB YYYY-MM-DD-Name-audio.mp4 and  DRB YYYY-MM-DD-Name-video.mp4
    * for example: DRB 2023-06-19-54WMain-audio.mp4 and DRB 2023-06-19-54WMain-video.mp4

1. Store on the Zoning Administrator’s Computer

1. Send the Google Drive link to the ZA.

1. The Zoning Administrator will download the recordings to a City-owned computer for permanent storage and tell the Zoom Host when all other copies of the recordings can be deleted.

## Delete from Zoom and Google Drive 

1. Delete the recordings from the personal Google Drive account. There is a limit on free storage capacity.
    :::note NOTE:
    Thirty days after deletion, Zoom will warn the Zoning Administrator that the recording will be permanently deleted.
    :::

1. Track workflow in a separate document, like this:
    * OK to delete?
    * Deleted from Drive
    * Deleted from Zoom
