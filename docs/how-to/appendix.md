## Who Does What?

The Zoom Host and the Zoning Administrator handle most tasks involved with managing the meeting, but officers and other members might be asked to fill in from time to time.

:::note NOTE:  
Currently, the Zoning Administrator is Peter, and the Zoom Host is Carrie.

| Task | Who's Responsible |
| ---- | ----------------- |
| Set up and manage technology | Zoning Administrator, Zoom Host |
| Set up and manage Conference Room in City Hall | Zoning Administrator, Zoom Host |
| Manage participants in Zoom Room | DRB officers |
| Fill in when an officer can’t attend | DRB members |
| Manage the Zoom account | Zoning Administrator (owner), Zoom Host |

## Host vs. Co-host Permissions in Zoom

These are the reasons why we assign host and co-host roles in the Zoom room:

* Host: The host can start and end the meeting, assign co-hosting permissions, manage participants, share screen, and record.
* Co-host:  The co-host can manage participants, share screen, and record. (They cannot start and end the meeting or assign co-hosting permissions.)
* (For a full comparison of Zoom roles and permissions, see [Roles in a Meeting](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/360040324512-Roles-in-a-meeting).

## If the Zoom Link Is Changed

Normally, we use the same Zoom link for every meeting. If you change the link, be sure to test the new link at least one week before the meeting.

1. Approximately one week in advance, the Zoning Administrator and the Zoom Host try using the new link to start a meeting.
2. If the link doesn’t work and the problem can’t be fixed, you might need to cancel or reschedule the meeting. At this point, the broken link has already been shared in the newspaper.
