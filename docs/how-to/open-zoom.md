# Open Zoom

The Zoom Host starts the meeting and manages participants.

## Log in to Zoom

1. On the Conference Room computer, open the Zoom desktop app.

    :::note NOTE
    Open Zoom from the desktop app, not from the Zoom website. The website often requests a passcode that the ZA has to retrieve from their personal email account.
    :::
1. If Zoom doesn’t ask for a login, it’s already logged in to someone else’s account. Tell Zoom to switch accounts:

    * In the top right of the Zoom window, click on the profile icon.
    * Select **Switch Account**.
    * When Zoom asks for a login, use the wireless keyboard to enter the ZA's Zoom username and password.
1. If Zoom requests a passcode, get the passcode from the ZA's personal email account and enter the passcode.

## Start the Meeting

1. At the top of the Zoom window, select **Meetings**.
2. Under the **Upcoming** tab, select the meeting you want to start. Additional options will appear.
3. Select **Start** for the DRB meeting.

## Change the ZA Display Name

1. In the Zoom window, select **Participants**.
1. Mouse over the ZA's name and select **More > Rename**.
1. Type `DRB`.

## Change Security Settings

:::note NOTE
Security settings are useful if you need to pause the meeting to deal with a Zoom bomber.
:::

1. In the Zoom window, select **Security**.
1. Uncheck **Share whiteboards** and **Collaborate with Zoom apps**.
1. Notice the option to **Suspend participant activities**. If a Zoom bomber joins the meeting, check this option to pause the meeting and determine which participant to remove.

## Admit participants

1. Watch for a notification that someone has joined the waiting room.
1. Select **Admit** to let the person into the meeting room:
    * Before the meeting start time, admit only DRB members.
    * After the meeting start time, admit anyone.
1. Assign co-hosting permissions to DRB officers.
