# Intro

Meetings of the Vergennes Development Review Board (DRB) are hybrid. People may attend in person at City Hall, or online via Zoom. The DRB Zoom Host manages meeting operations, including setting up the City Hall Conference Room, managing the Zoom meeting room, and recording public hearings. The Zoom account is owned by the Zoning Administrator (ZA). The ZA shares their Zoom credentials with the Zoom Host.
