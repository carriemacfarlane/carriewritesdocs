The DRB Zoom Host manages meeting operations, including setting up the City Hall Conference Room, managing the Zoom meeting room, and recording public hearings. The the Zoom account is owned by the Zoning Administrator (ZA). The ZA shares their Zoom credentials with the Zoom Host.

* The Zoom Host saves meeting documents to a USB drive and brings the USB drive to the meeting.
* The ZA and the Zoom Host arrive at City Hall twenty minutes before the meeting.
