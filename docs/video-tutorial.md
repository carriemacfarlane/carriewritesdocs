# Video Tutorial

This video was part of an online assignment that preceded the PsycINFO training sessions I led when I was a librarian. It allowed me to use an active learning approach in my instruction. The students watched the video and experimented with PsycINFO, then asked questions when they met with me. They learned by doing, which helped them recognize that they needed advice.
