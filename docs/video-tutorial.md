# Video Tutorial

This video was part of an online assignment for the PsycINFO training sessions I led when I was a librarian. It allowed me to use an active learning approach in my instruction. The students watched the video, experimented with PsycINFO, then asked questions. They learned by doing, and I was their guide.
