I’m creating templates for colleagues to use when they write articles for the internal knowledgebase. This week, I tested my how-to template by comparing it to an older how-to article that was already published. The article was user-friendly in many ways. It focused on a single problem, it opened with an informative scope statement, and it provided plenty of white space.

What my editorial eye zoomed in on was the lower half of the page. The content there was divided into a series of short paragraphs, each only 1 or 2 sentences long. When I read the paragraphs more closely, I realized that many of them were troubleshooting steps.

I concluded that my how-to template should call out the importance of using numbered lists for steps. It will need to explain why numbered lists are helpful to readers.

### What I’m Working On

* Templates

### Questions

* Why should we use bulleted lists and numbered lists?
* Why should long lists be organized and divided into sections with headings?
* Why do we need white space?

### Answers

* People don’t read online, they seek
* To guide the reader’s attention, ask: Can you break any complicated concepts out into groups of simple items? If the answer is yes, then use numbered (or, *ordered*) lists for sequential items, and use bulleted (or, *unordered*) lists for non-sequential items
