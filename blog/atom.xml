        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My colleagues are nice, and this is a problem! Often, when I ask for feedback about internal knowledgebase articles, I hear gratitude and praise. Our docs are good! The feedback is genuine and specific. But I want to help people feel more comfortable with providing a balanced critique. So when a UX researcher in a podcast I was listening to referred to a “red pen, green pen test,” I made a mental note to google it later.</p>
<p>I learned that in a red pen, green pen test, you hand your subject a printed document and 2 pens. You tell them to use the pens to underline text that stands out: green for sentences that increase confidence, and red for sentences that decrease confidence. Then, you talk with them about what they underlined.</p>
<p>I tried the red pen, green pen test, and the results were fantastic. As usual, I heard praise. (“It’s great that it reminds people to include the problem in the work order title; when folks are new, I see generic titles like “Call back.”) But I also heard critical observations. (“We don’t create a work order from this screen because it’s too easy to select the wrong customer.”) At the end of the test, I told my subjects I appreciated their honesty. One of them responded that it was easy:  “We were instructed to use the red pen!”</p>
<p>Even though these particular subjects are notoriously nice, I came away with actionable feedback. As a result, I made a document more useful to more people.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Our style guide tells writers to include screenshots in how-to articles only if the screenshots are really necessary. For those times when we do include screenshots, I researched what kinds of descriptions to include in the alternative text. Often, a caption seems like it would be suitable for alt text, too. Should alt text be a simple copy-paste of the text in the caption?</p>
<p>I found two different but related answers. The W3C alt Decision Tree says that if the alt text also appears nearby, the alt text is redundant, and you should provide an empty alt attribute. At the same time, a Nielsen Norman video about alt text says that if the text on the page refers to the screenshot, you must provide alt text. If you don’t, then people using screen readers might wonder if they’ve missed some of your content.</p>
<p>We always refer to screenshots in the text of our articles, so I’ll follow Nielsen Norman’s advice. But I’ll also follow the advice of the W3C.</p>
<p>Our style guide will say that alt text should refer back to the text where it’s described, and it shouldn't be a simple copy-paste of the caption. So an alt text description might say something like this: “Usernames tab of License Window, described in the text above.” And a caption might say something like this: “Usernames tab of License Window.”</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>With so many people talking about artificial intelligence, I figured I might as well ask: Am I using AI like other writers? Here are 2 stories that tell me I am.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://passo.uno/ai-tech-writer-examples/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How I'm Using AI as a Technical Writer</a>, Fabrizio Ferri Benedetti says he uses AI for tedious tasks, and to provide support when he’s working outside his areas of expertise. Like Fabrizio, I use AI to do tedious work, and I’ve turned to AI for support! For example, when I needed to convert several pages of bulleted text to indented text, I fed the article to ChatGPT. And, since I lack subject expertise in accounting, I’ve asked Claude to check my explanations of things like general ledgers and assets as I build a user guide for new accounting software. I also called on ChatGPT when I needed a cheeky name for my fantasy football team! Talking trash is definitely not one of my strengths.</p>
<p>AI is helping me do my job, but I know it comes with a cost. I worry about decreased creative output, increased energy consumption, and a potential lack of interesting careers for younger people. So I was gratified to hear Mignon Fogarty’s podcast about AI. In <a href="https://youtu.be/r6_nLTHZ1r4?si=jlmt9dC6dqmmjuWt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Struggling With AI: Job Loss, Energy Use, and More</a>, Mignon discusses these concerns with Christopher Penn. We don't have answers, but at least we’re  keeping tabs on some of the risks.</p>
<p>So yes, I’m using AI like other writers! But of course I still have more to learn. Along comes Steve Arrants, another technical writer who I follow. He posted to LinkedIn that he’s experimenting with NotebookLM. So that’s now on my to-do list!</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few years ago, during my new employee orientation, a couple of teammates pulled me aside to warn me about the word <em>customer</em>. “It won’t always mean what you think!” one of them suggested. “I was confused by it for <em>months</em>!” the other laughed. For a long time, the word <em>customer</em> had been used for both clients and clients of clients. Miscommunication is inevitable when people apply different meanings to the same word, and my colleagues wanted to save me from making mistakes.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard about a unified terminology initiative at a company called Genetec that reminded me of what my two helpful colleagues had said. What prompted the initiative? Different software systems were applying different meanings to the same words, and one of the words was <em>customer</em>. Kelly Lawetz, Director of Unified Content at Genetec, explained that terminology conflicts were preventing the company from merging systems data, and top-level executives recognized that the problem needed to be addressed.</p>
<p>Terminology conflicts were scattered throughout my company, too. Employees in different areas used different definitions, spelling, and capitalization for the same industry terms, departments, and features. We all recognized this was a problem, and I felt I might be in a position to address it. I had been hired to write effective documentation, and my ability to succeed would be limited if my words were interpreted differently by different readers.</p>
<p>My first step was to propose a glossary for our internal knowledgebase. I suggested that in the future, people might like it so much that we’d be able to expand its scope. I’m pragmatic, so taking an incremental approach to change appeals to me. But I’ve sometimes wondered if my pragmatism is actually complacency! Based on Kelly’s success story, it’s not. “Start small,” Kelly suggested. “Manage and build what you control.” If you demonstrate value quickly, people will willingly join your initiative.</p>
<p>And that’s exactly what happened with our glossary. People embraced it! First, they began requesting new entries. Then, they added it to the curriculum of new employee orientation. Later, it became a go-to resource for external marketing. Its usage statistics continued to tick upward, and now it regularly ranks in the top five of several hundred pages. Last month, we changed its title. The knowledgebase glossary is now the company glossary!</p>

This principle reminds me of an issue that I grappled with when I was developing a content management policy for our internal knowledgebase.

But it’s difficult to justify setting aside big blocks of time to review all old content at once. And our analytics aren’t robust enough to reveal the articles that are most in need of attention.</p>
<p>My solution was to let our users guide our attention. Our content management policy tells us to review all articles against a current pre-publication checklist when someone asks us to update them. I call this strategy “pragmatic content management,” and there are two reasons why I love it. First, it helps me feel confident that reviewing an article is worth my time: if someone has bothered to report a broken link or an outdated screenshot, I know they care about the article! And second, it prompts me to chip away at old content every few weeks instead of waiting until I have a big block of time (aka never!).</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had drafted a new workflow for the internal documentation team, and it was my job to present it. Our goal was to transition away from group-based content production. For months, we’d been meeting every week to edit knowledgebase articles line-by-line before we approved them for publication. This meant that at least five sets of eyes were searching for the same errors at the same time.</p>
<p>Our process had built camaraderie and created a shared understanding of style conventions, but it was inefficient, and we had outgrown it. The new workflow put an end to weekly review sessions by dividing the process into phases, defining new roles, and introducing support like templates and a checklist. It would be a major change.</p>
<p>There was a lot to take in, and the team needed to understand everything well enough to provide informed feedback. I had an hour-long meeting and there were other topics on the agenda. How would I share the information quickly, despite its complexity? Words alone would not suffice. I needed a visualization. A flowchart!</p>
<p>Years ago, when a colleague told me she’d signed up for a course about flowcharts, I remember thinking, “Oh! There’s a method for designing flowcharts?!” Now that I wanted to design one myself, I wondered what my colleague had learned. I searched for tips online.</p>
<p>I found a few good sites, and I followed their advice. I loved what I came up with! An oval signified the beginning of the process, when the coordinator received a documentation request. Diamonds marked decision points, like when an editor assigned a request to a writer. Rectangles enclosed most of the other steps, like writing, reviewing, and revising. The flowchart described the entire workflow, but it was clear and concise. I even felt it was  engaging! But the team would be the best judge of that.</p>
<p>I presented the new workflow to the team, and they liked it! They asked questions about a few scenarios and made suggestions to accomodate them. They also <em>oooh</em>ed and <em>ahhh</em>ed over the flowchart. (Did I mention I have a really supportive team?) They enthusiastically agreed to adopt the new workflow, and we moved on to the next agenda item.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’ve come a long way! One of the first things I did when I became interested in technical writing was research the field. I found a great book, <em>The Insider’s Guide to Technical Writing</em> by Krista Van Laan, and I read it every day during my commute to the library. I filled it with bright green post-it notes to remind me of key points when I got my first job. Recently, one of those post-it notes helped me strengthen a relationship with a valued colleague.</p>
<p>Most of my current employer's documentation was written by a colleague who has been with the company for more than a decade. We meet from time-to-time, but we work in different collections. Recently, we’ve started to review one another’s work.</p>
<p>We needed to set clear expectations for what we would and wouldn’t correct during review, so I proposed that we adopt a pre-publication checklist. I had created a checklist for the collection that I work in, so I suggested we use that as a foundation. I asked my colleague to take a look and suggest any changes. He said he liked the checklist quite a bit! It conformed to his style conventions and met his needs.</p>
<p>My colleague asked out of curiosity how I’d developed the checklist. I used many sources, but the backbone of the checklist came directly from a post-it I had affixed to one of the pages of Krista Van Laan’s book. Van Laan said that the best documentation is accurate, complete, error-free, and usable. I had recorded those priorities on a post-it, and I adopted them as the 4 main goals of the checklist.</p>
<p><em>The Insider's Guide to Technical Writing</em> made me feel so excited to become a tech writer! And now it's helped me create a checklist that an experienced colleague is willing to adopt. It’s fun to reminisce about that time of exploration, and it’s rewarding to see the results of my research.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My colleagues and I were having trouble communicating with one another. People were using different names for the same user interface (UI) elements. It would be an enormous undertaking to change communication habits across an organization, but one achievable first step we could take, I figured, would be to change terminology in written documents.</p>
<p>So I decided to create a visual glossary of UI elements. The glossary would make it easy for writers to consistently use a single name for any given window or form. Because some UI elements aren’t labeled, I also would need to provide instructions on how to name UI elements. If we needed to refer to an unlabeled UI element, I could assign a name to it based on the rules in the naming guide. At the core of this naming guide was a hierarchy of color-coded categories and examples. I wanted to call the hierarchy a taxonomy.</p>
<p>But <em>was</em> it a taxonomy? I knew the term from librarianship. Librarians in my field used taxonomies to assign metadata in digital repositories. I’d seen the term occasionally in tech comm publications, but I hadn’t paid much attention to it. Now I wondered, do technical communicators use the term <em>taxonomy</em> in the same way that librarians do? It would be counterproductive (and ironic!) if I misused a term in my naming guide.</p>
<p>How do technical communicators use the term <em>taxonomy</em>? I did a little research. I found a great article that led me to a great webinar. And a book! (See below.) I learned that in technical communication <em>and</em> librarianship, a taxonomy is a system that facilitates categorization of information. It uses tools including hierarchies and controlled vocabulary to help people derive meaning from things like names, tags, headings, and labels. I called the hierarchy in my naming guide a taxonomy.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Back during my first few months as a tech writer, I was working on documentation for complicated software that’s used in an industry I knew nothing about. I felt like a blindfolded tour guide. If you’re a tech writer, you’ve probably felt like this sometimes, too! You can find your way to walls and then doors, but you can’t bring people to the rooms they want to go to. Ultimately, it was my experience as a librarian that helped me navigate.</p>
<p>After an interview with a subject matter expert and some experimentation, I'd learned enough to write accurate instructions. But as a former librarian who has led thousands of training sessions, I thought the instructions for the most complicated functions would be easier to understand if they were accompanied by examples. Since I wasn’t familiar with the industry, though, if I was going to provide realistic examples, I’d need to do more research.</p>
<p>I didn’t want to disappoint my new colleagues by taking too long. And I really didn’t want to place an unnecessary burden on my subject matter expert. I wondered if I should consider the job done. At this point, the blindfold was off: I could guide readers to the essential places, I just couldn’t explain very well why they’d want to go there.</p>
<p>Would it be worth the time it took to identify and write realistic examples? I did a little research and confirmed what I already knew to be true: concrete examples are useful in documentation, too.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I review draft knowledgebase articles for publication, I provide feedback and explanations that I extract from our style guide. My hope is that if the author understands why I’ve made a suggestion, they’ll make the change on their own next time. Sometimes, I double-check to make sure the rationale in our style guide is still valid.</p>
<p>Recently, when I double-checked a style convention that I had long thought to be true, I found a bit of controversy. I had been taught that lists with more than 7-10 steps should be divided into sections with subheadings. Because cognitive psychology research showed that people can remember about 7 chunks of information at a time, many web designers concluded that menus should contain no more than 7 items, plus or minus 2. This “Seven, Plus or Minus Two” convention made sense in technical writing, too: excessively long to-do lists are overwhelming.</p>
<p>However, it now seems that web designers took cognitive research too far. The research was about memory, not reading. Yes, people can remember about 7 chunks of information, but they can <em>read</em> more than that!</p>
<p>What does this discovery mean for our style guide? Understanding the finer points of this convention will help me provide informed feedback, but I’m not going to change the guide. Even refutations of the 7 plus or minus 2 rule still say that structure and hierarchy are essential. Breaking a long list into sections with subheadings remains a best practice.</p>

<p>I decided to submit a feature request! I would propose dividing the form into labeled sections and moving a couple of fields. My colleagues agreed the form is complicated.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Technical communication podcasts funnel my thoughts toward work every morning during my commute. In a <em>Content Strategy</em> podcast that I listened to a few days ago, Kristina Halvorson’s guest Chelsea Larsson referred to something called the Trust Equation. As Larsson described it, the Trust Equation is a framework that illustrates how people assess the trustworthiness of their colleagues. It caught my attention because it validated my approach to work life. I think I have a decent chance of getting a good score!</p>
<p>In the Trust Equation, self-orientation is the denominator. I tend to keep my self-orientation at work fairly low. I prefer learning about colleagues to talking about myself, and showing that I care about other people  makes me feel good.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I started working on a help article for a data entry form. The form produces reports that can be used to evaluate profitability, uncover data entry errors, send mass mailings, and more. The form has grown longer over the years, and it now contains more than 30 input fields with no section dividers and no headings. The goal of my article was to define all the fields. This was a thorny information architecture challenge.</p>
<p>How would I format the article so that a reader could quickly make sense of the content? If I listed the fields one after the other with no section dividers and no headings, my list would be too long to comprehend. If I divided the list into categories, that would falsely suggest that the form is divided into categories too.</p>
<p>As a writer, I know that separating large blocks of content into chunks makes scanning easier, and as a former educator, I know that organizing content into meaningful categories helps people learn. So, I decided to break my lists into sections based on the order in which the fields appear in the form. Within each section, I would create subsections based on function.</p>
<p>This is an imperfect solution, but it’s the best solution for now. (Separately, I’ll recommend a new organization scheme for the form!) I found a couple of sources to support my decisions.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I’m creating templates for colleagues to use when they write articles for the internal knowledgebase. This week, I tested my how-to template by comparing it to an older how-to article that was already published. The article was user-friendly in many ways. It focused on a single problem, it opened with an informative scope statement, and it provided plenty of white space.</p>
<p>What my editorial eye zoomed in on was the lower half of the page. The content there was divided into a series of short paragraphs, each only 1 or 2 sentences long. When I read the paragraphs more closely, I realized that many of them were troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>I concluded that my how-to template should call out the importance of using numbered lists for steps. It will need to explain why numbered lists are helpful to readers.</p>

<li>People don’t read online, they seek</li>
<li>To guide the reader’s attention, ask: Can you break any complicated concepts out into groups of simple items? If the answer is yes, then use numbered (or, <em>ordered</em>) lists for sequential items, and use bulleted (or, <em>unordered</em>) lists for non-sequential items</li>
