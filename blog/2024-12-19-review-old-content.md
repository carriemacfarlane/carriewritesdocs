According to Nielsen Norman’s [Content Strategy 101](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/content-strategy/), content management policies should define when and how older content is reviewed for quality. This principle reminds me of an issue that I grappled with when I was developing a content management policy for our internal knowledgebase. Our publication standards had evolved, and some of our older content wasn’t as readable as we wanted it to be. But it’s difficult to justify setting aside big blocks of time to review all old content at once. And our analytics aren’t robust enough to reveal the articles that are most in need of attention.

My solution was to let our users guide our attention. Our content management policy tells us to review all articles against a current pre-publication checklist when someone asks us to update them. I call this strategy “pragmatic content management,” and there are two reasons why I love it. First, it helps me feel confident that reviewing an article is worth my time: if someone has bothered to report a broken link or an outdated screenshot, I know they care about the article! And second, it prompts me to chip away at old content every few weeks instead of waiting until I have a big block of time (aka never!).
