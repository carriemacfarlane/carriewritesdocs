I’ve come a long way! One of the first things I did when I became interested in technical writing was research the field. I found a great book, *The Insider’s Guide to Technical Writing* by Krista Van Laan, and I read it every day during my commute to the library. I filled it with bright green post-it notes to remind me of key points when I got my first job. Recently, one of those post-it notes helped me strengthen a relationship with a valued colleague.

Most of my current employer's documentation was written by a colleague who has been with the company for more than a decade. We meet from time-to-time, but we work in different collections. Recently, we’ve started to review one another’s work.

We needed to set clear expectations for what we would and wouldn’t correct during review, so I proposed that we adopt a pre-publication checklist. I had created a checklist for the collection that I work in, so I suggested we use that as a foundation. I asked my colleague to take a look and suggest any changes. He said he liked the checklist quite a bit! It conformed to his style conventions and met his needs.

My colleague asked out of curiosity how I’d developed the checklist. I used many sources, but the backbone of the checklist came directly from a post-it I had affixed to one of the pages of Krista Van Laan’s book. Van Laan said that the best documentation is accurate, complete, error-free, and usable. I had recorded those priorities on a post-it, and I adopted them as the 4 main goals of the checklist.

*The Insider's Guide to Technical Writing* made me feel so excited to become a tech writer! And now it's helped me create a checklist that an experienced colleague is willing to adopt. It’s fun to reminisce about that time of exploration, and it’s rewarding to see the results of my research.

*When I was a librarian, I told students to do question-based research and to cite their sources. Now that I'm a technical writer, I follow my own advice in this journal of my work.*
