Somewhere in the midst of my struggle to write a help article for a very long data entry form, a lightbulb clicked on in my mind. I already knew that my article would be more concise if the form was divided into sections with labels. For example, instead of directing people to the *bottom-left corner* of the form, I could direct them to, say, the *output section*. Why not suggest dividing the form into sections?

I decided to submit a feature request! I would propose dividing the form into labeled sections and moving a couple of fields. My colleagues agreed the form is complicated. Dividing it into sections would make it easier to use. But like a good librarian (in my case, a good former librarian), I wanted to provide a rationale with citations.
