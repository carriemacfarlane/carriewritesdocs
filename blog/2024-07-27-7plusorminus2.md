When I review draft knowledgebase articles for publication, I provide feedback and explanations that I extract from our style guide. My hope is that if the author understands why I’ve made a suggestion, they’ll make the change on their own next time. Sometimes, I double-check to make sure the rationale in our style guide is still valid.

Recently, when I double-checked a style convention that I had long thought to be true, I found a bit of controversy. I had been taught that lists with more than 7-10 steps should be divided into sections with subheadings. Because cognitive psychology research showed that people can remember about 7 chunks of information at a time, many web designers concluded that menus should contain no more than 7 items, plus or minus 2. This “Seven, Plus or Minus Two” convention made sense in technical writing, too: excessively long to-do lists are overwhelming.

However, it now seems that web designers took cognitive research too far. The research was about memory, not reading. Yes, people can remember about 7 chunks of information, but they can *read* more than that!

What does this discovery mean for our style guide? Understanding the finer points of this convention will help me provide informed feedback, but I’m not going to change the guide. Even refutations of the 7 plus or minus 2 rule still say that structure and hierarchy are essential. Breaking a long list into sections with subheadings remains a best practice.

### What I’m Working On

* Advice about ordered and unordered lists

### Question

* How many items in a list is too many items?

### Answers

* Lists should contain no more than 7-10 items
* If a list contains more than 7-10 items, divide the list into sections with headings
