I was reviewing a draft article for our knowledgebase when I realized that I needed to add advice about screenshots to our style guide. I’d nearly been lulled into complacency as I ticked off items in our pre-publication checklist. Yes, the scope statement was accurate; yes, the instructions were written as numbered steps; yes, large screenshots were annotated…

Wait. Those screenshots were really large. I had to scroll to get past them! They were distracting. The screenshots added value, but they needed to be smaller.

I checked our style guide and confirmed it provided no advice about how much of a screen to include in a screenshot. I’d have to add advice, and I wanted to cite some research for people who were interested in learning more.

### What I’m Working On

* Screenshots

### Question

* How much of a screen should be captured in a screenshot?

### Answers

* Include only the relevant parts of the screen, with enough context to reassure the reader that they're in the right place.
* Cropping helps the reader focus on the information that you want to convey
* Cropping can future-proof a screenshot in case other parts of the interface change.

*When I was a librarian, I told students to do question-based research and to cite their sources. Now that I'm a technical writer, I follow my own advice in this blog.*
