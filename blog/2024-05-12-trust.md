Technical communication podcasts funnel my thoughts toward work every morning during my commute. In a *Content Strategy* podcast that I listened to a few days ago, Kristina Halvorsonâ€™s guest Chelsea Larsson referred to something called the Trust Equation. As Larsson described it, the Trust Equation is a framework that describes how people assess the trustworthiness of their colleagues. It caught my attention because it validated my approach to work life. I think I have a decent chance of getting a good score!

In the Trust Equation, self-orientation is the denominator. I tend to keep my self-orientation at work fairly low. I prefer learning about colleagues to talking about myself, and showing that I care about other people  makes me feel good.
