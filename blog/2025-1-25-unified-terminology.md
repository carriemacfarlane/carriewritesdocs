A few years ago, during my new employee orientation, a couple of teammates pulled me aside to warn me about the word *customer*. “It won’t always mean what you think!” one of them suggested. “I was confused by it for *months*!” the other laughed. For a long time, the word *customer* had been used for both clients and clients of clients. Miscommunication is inevitable when people apply different meanings to the same word, and my colleagues wanted to save me from making mistakes.

Recently, I heard about a unified terminology initiative at a company called Genetec that reminded me of what my two helpful colleagues had said. What prompted the initiative? Different software systems were applying different meanings to the same words, and one of the words was *customer*. Kelly Lawetz, Director of Unified Content at Genetec, explained that terminology conflicts were preventing the company from merging systems data, and top-level executives recognized that the problem needed to be addressed.

Terminology conflicts were scattered throughout my company, too. Employees in different areas used different definitions, spelling, and capitalization for the same industry terms, departments, and features. We all recognized this was a problem, and I felt I might be in a position to address it. I had been hired to write effective documentation, and my ability to succeed would be limited if my words were interpreted differently by different readers.

My first step was to propose a glossary for our internal knowledgebase. I suggested that in the future, people might like it so much that we’d be able to expand its scope. I’m pragmatic, so taking an incremental approach to change appeals to me. But I’ve sometimes wondered if my pragmatism is actually complacency! Based on Kelly’s success story, it’s not. “Start small,” Kelly suggested. “Manage and build what you control.” If you demonstrate value quickly, people will willingly join your initiative.

And that’s exactly what happened with our glossary. People embraced it! First, they began requesting new entries. Then, they added it to the curriculum of new employee orientation. Later, it became a go-to resource for external marketing. Its usage statistics continued to tick upward, and now it regularly ranks in the top five of several hundred pages. Last month, we changed its title. The knowledgebase glossary is now the company glossary!
