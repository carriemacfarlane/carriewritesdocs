We had drafted a new workflow for the internal documentation team, and it was my job to present it. Our goal was to transition away from group-based content production. For months, we’d been meeting every week to edit knowledgebase articles line-by-line before we approved them for publication. This meant that at least five sets of eyes were searching for the same errors at the same time.

Our process had built camaraderie and created a shared understanding of style conventions, but it was inefficient, and we had outgrown it. The new workflow put an end to weekly review sessions by dividing the process into phases, defining new roles, and introducing support like templates and a checklist. It would be a major change.

There was a lot to take in, and the team needed to understand everything well enough to provide informed feedback. I had an hour-long meeting and there were other topics on the agenda. How would I share the information quickly, despite its complexity? Words alone would not suffice. I needed a visualization. A flowchart!

Years ago, when a colleague told me she’d signed up for a course about flowcharts, I remember thinking, “Oh! There’s a method for designing flowcharts?!” Now that I wanted to design one myself, I wondered what my colleague had learned. I searched for tips online.

I found a few good sites, and I followed their advice. I loved what I came up with! An oval signified the beginning of the process, when the coordinator received a documentation request. Diamonds marked decision points, like when an editor assigned a request to a writer. Rectangles enclosed most of the other steps, like writing, reviewing, and revising. The flowchart described the entire workflow, but it was clear and concise. I even felt it was  engaging! But the team would be the best judge of that.

I presented the new workflow to the team, and they liked it! They asked questions about a few scenarios and made suggestions to accomodate them. They also *oooh*ed and *ahhh*ed over the flowchart. (Did I mention I have a really supportive team?) They enthusiastically agreed to adopt the new workflow, and we moved on to the next agenda item.

### What I’m Working On

* Knowledgebase publication workflow

### Question

* How should I design a flowchart?

### Answers

* Use ovals for the beginning or end of a process
* Use diamonds for decision points
* Use rectangles for other steps
