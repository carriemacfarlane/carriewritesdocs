When we revamped our editorial workflow and stopped reviewing draft knowledgebase articles in live group editing sessions, we needed to find a new way for reviewers to give feedback. In a  group session, a reviewer could express the sentiment behind their feedback in a conversation. A reviewer might ask, “I don’t understand that, what do you mean?” And the writer would explain. At the end, if a writer wasn’t sure where revisions were required, they could ask.

In our new workflow, reviewers would leave comments in drafts for writers to read later. How would the reviewers efficiently express the sentiment behind their feedback? We decided to use the [Conventional Comments](https://conventionalcomments.org/) method, which I had learned about from my work with The Good Docs Project. Reviewers would label comments with tags like QUESTION, SUGGESTION, or ISSUE. The definitions for the tags would express the sentiment behind the comments. SUGGESTION means it’s up to the writer, while ISSUE means a revision is required.

Reviewers and writers love the Conventional Comments method! In many ways, it’s better than a conversation. It's unambiguous and succinct, and it reminds reviewers of the types of feedback they should provide. A label called PRAISE is perhaps the most valuable. It prompts reviewers to tell writers when they’ve done something well, and this helps all of us improve our craft.
