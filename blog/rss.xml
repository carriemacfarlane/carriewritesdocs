            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m creating templates for colleagues to use when they write articles for the internal Knowledgebase. This week, I tested my how-to template by comparing it to an older how-to article that was already published in the Knowledgebase. The article in the Knowledgebase was user-friendly in many ways. It focused on a single problem, it opened with an informative scope statement, and it provided plenty of white space.</p>
<p>What my editorial eye zoomed in on was the lower half of the page. The content there was divided into a series of short paragraphs, each only 1 or 2 sentences long. When I read the paragraphs more closely, I realized that many of them were troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>I concluded that my how-to template should call out the importance of using numbered lists for steps. It will need to explain why numbered lists are helpful to readers.</p>

<li>People don’t read online, they seek</li>
<li>To guide the reader’s attention, ask: Can you break any complicated concepts out into groups of simple items? If the answer is yes, then use numbered (or, <em>ordered</em>) lists for sequential items, and use bulleted (or, <em>unordered</em>) lists for non-sequential items</li>
