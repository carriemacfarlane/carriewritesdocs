            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Technical communication podcasts funnel my thoughts toward work every morning during my commute. In a <em>Content Strategy</em> podcast that I listened to a few days ago, Kristina Halvorson’s guest Chelsea Larsson referred to something called the Trust Equation. As Larsson described it, the Trust Equation is a framework that illustrates how people assess the trustworthiness of their colleagues. It caught my attention because it validated my approach to work life. I think I have a decent chance of getting a good score!</p>
<p>In the Trust Equation, self-orientation is the denominator. I tend to keep my self-orientation at work fairly low. I prefer learning about colleagues to talking about myself, and showing that I care about other people  makes me feel good.</p>

            <description><![CDATA[A few weeks ago, I started working on a help article for a data entry form. The form produces reports that can be used to evaluate profitability, uncover data entry errors, send mass mailings, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A few weeks ago, I started working on a help article for a data entry form. The form produces reports that can be used to evaluate profitability, uncover data entry errors, send mass mailings, and more. The form has grown longer over the years, and it now contains more than 30 input fields with no section dividers and no headings. The goal of my article was to define all the fields. This was a thorny challenge for information architecture.</p>
<p>How would I format the article so that a reader could quickly make sense of the content? If I listed the fields one after the other with no section dividers and no headings, my list would be too long to comprehend. If I divided the list into categories, that would falsely suggest that the form is divided into categories too.</p>
<p>As a writer, I know that separating large blocks of content into chunks makes scanning easier, and as a former educator, I know that organizing content into meaningful categories helps people learn. So I decided to break my lists into sections based on the order in which the fields appear in the form. Within each section, I would create subsections based on function.</p>
<p>This is an imperfect solution, but it’s the best solution for now. (Separately, I’ll recommend a new organization scheme for the form!) I found a couple of sources to support my decisions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I’m creating templates for colleagues to use when they write articles for the internal Knowledgebase. This week, I tested my how-to template by comparing it to an older how-to article that was already published in the Knowledgebase. The article in the Knowledgebase was user-friendly in many ways. It focused on a single problem, it opened with an informative scope statement, and it provided plenty of white space.</p>
<p>What my editorial eye zoomed in on was the lower half of the page. The content there was divided into a series of short paragraphs, each only 1 or 2 sentences long. When I read the paragraphs more closely, I realized that many of them were troubleshooting steps.</p>
<p>I concluded that my how-to template should call out the importance of using numbered lists for steps. It will need to explain why numbered lists are helpful to readers.</p>

<ul>
<li>People don’t read online, they seek</li>
<li>To guide the reader’s attention, ask: Can you break any complicated concepts out into groups of simple items? If the answer is yes, then use numbered (or, <em>ordered</em>) lists for sequential items, and use bulleted (or, <em>unordered</em>) lists for non-sequential items</li>
