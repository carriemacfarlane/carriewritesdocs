## About Me

I'm an amateur gardener, a novice sailor, and a lifelong friend of felines.

## About This Site

I chose the Docusaurus SSG (static site generator) for this site because a tech writer colleague moved their docs to Docusaurus and was happy with the change. Iâ€™m using GitHub to maintain the site because I want to keep my Git skills current.
