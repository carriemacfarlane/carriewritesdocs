The form has grown longer over the years, and it now contains more than 30 input fields with no section dividers and no headings. The goal of my article was to define all the fields. This was a thorny challenge for information architecture.\\n\\nHow would I format the article so that a reader could quickly make sense of the content? If I listed the fields one after the other with no section dividers and no headings, my list would be too long to comprehend. If I divided the list into categories, that would falsely suggest that the form is divided into categories too.\\n\\nAs a writer, I know that separating large blocks of content into chunks makes scanning easier, and as a former educator, I know that organizing content into meaningful categories helps people learn. So I decided to break my lists into sections based on the order in which the fields appear in the form. Within each section, I would create subsections based on function.\\n\\nThis is an imperfect solution, but it\u2019s the best solution for now. (Separately, I\u2019ll recommend a new organization scheme for the form!) I found a couple of sources to support my decisions.\\n\\n## Questions\\n\\n* Why should large blocks of content be divided into sections?\\n* Why should content be organized into categories?\\n\\n## Answers\\n\\n* Breaking up large blocks of content into chunks makes scanning easier.\\n* Grouping related content together helps people understand it and remember it.\\n\\n## Citations\\n\\n* [Sources of Cognitive Load | The Learning Scientists](https://www.learningscientists.org/blog/2023/7/6?rq=chunk)\\n* [How Chunking Helps Content Processing | Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/)"},{"id":"lists","metadata":{"permalink":"/carriewritesdocs/blog/lists","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2024-03-24-lists.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-03-24-lists.md","title":"Ordered and Unordered Lists","description":"I\u2019m creating templates for colleagues to use when they write articles for the internal Knowledgebase.
