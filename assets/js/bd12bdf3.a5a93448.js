I filled it with bright green post-it notes to remind me of key points when I got my first job. Recently, one of those post-it notes helped me strengthen a relationship with a valued colleague.\\n\\nMost of my current employer\'s documentation was written by a colleague who has been with the company for more than a decade. We meet from time-to-time, but we work in different collections. Recently, we\u2019ve started to review one another\u2019s work.\\n\\nWe needed to set clear expectations for what we would and wouldn\u2019t correct during review, so I proposed that we adopt a pre-publication checklist. I had created a checklist for the collection that I work in, so I suggested we use that as a foundation. I asked my colleague to take a look and suggest any changes. He said he liked the checklist quite a bit! It conformed to his style conventions and met his needs.\\n\\nMy colleague asked out of curiosity how I\u2019d developed the checklist. I used many sources, but the backbone of the checklist came directly from a post-it I had affixed to one of the pages of Krista Van Laan\u2019s book. Van Laan said that the best documentation is accurate, complete, error-free, and usable. I had recorded those priorities on a post-it, and I adopted them as the 4 main goals of the checklist.\\n\\n*The Insider\'s Guide to Technical Writing* made me feel so excited to become a tech writer!

People were using different names for the same user interface (UI) elements. It would be an enormous undertaking to change communication habits across an organization, but one achievable first step we could take, I figured, would be to change terminology in written documents.\\n\\nSo I decided to create a visual glossary of UI elements. The glossary would make it easy for writers to consistently use a single name for any given window or form. Because some UI elements aren\u2019t labeled, I also would need to provide instructions on how to name UI elements. If we needed to refer to an unlabeled UI element, I could assign a name to it based on the rules in the naming guide. At the core of this naming guide was a hierarchy of color-coded categories and examples. I wanted to call the hierarchy a taxonomy.\\n\\nBut *was* it a taxonomy? I knew the term from librarianship. Librarians in my field used taxonomies to assign metadata in digital repositories. I\u2019d seen the term occasionally in tech comm publications, but I hadn\u2019t paid much attention to it. Now I wondered, do technical communicators use the term *taxonomy* in the same way that librarians do? It would be counterproductive (and ironic!) if I misused a term in my naming guide.\\n\\nHow do technical communicators use the term *taxonomy*? I did a little research. I found a great article that led me to a great webinar. And a book! (See below.) I learned that in technical communication *and* librarianship, a taxonomy is a system that facilitates categorization of information. It uses tools including hierarchies and controlled vocabulary to help people derive meaning from things like names, tags, headings, and labels.

Sometimes, I double-check to make sure the rationale in our style guide is still valid.\\n\\nRecently, when I double-checked a style convention that I had long thought to be true, I found a bit of controversy. I had been taught that lists with more than 7-10 steps should be divided into sections with subheadings. Because cognitive psychology research showed that people can remember about 7 chunks of information at a time, many web designers concluded that menus should contain no more than 7 items, plus or minus 2. This \u201cSeven, Plus or Minus Two\u201d convention made sense in technical writing, too: excessively long to-do lists are overwhelming.\\n\\nHowever, it now seems that web designers took cognitive research too far. The research was about memory, not reading. Yes, people can remember about 7 chunks of information, but they can *read* more than that!\\n\\nWhat does this discovery mean for our style guide? Understanding the finer points of this convention will help me provide informed feedback, but I\u2019m not going to change the guide. Even refutations of the 7 plus or minus 2 rule still say that structure and hierarchy are essential.
