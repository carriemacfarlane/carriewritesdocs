You can find your way to walls and then doors, but you can\u2019t bring people to the rooms they want to go to. Ultimately, it was my experience as a librarian that helped me navigate.\\n\\nAfter an interview with a subject matter expert and some experimentation, I\'d learned enough to write accurate instructions. But as a former librarian who has led thousands of training sessions, I thought the instructions for the most complicated functions would be easier to understand if they were accompanied by examples. Since I wasn\u2019t familiar with the industry, though, if I was going to provide realistic examples, I\u2019d need to do more research.\\n\\nI didn\u2019t want to disappoint my new colleagues by taking too long. And I really didn\u2019t want to place an unnecessary burden on my subject matter expert. I wondered if I should consider the job done. At this point, the blindfold was off: I could guide readers to the essential places, I just couldn\u2019t explain very well why they\u2019d want to go there.\\n\\nWould it be worth the time it took to identify and write realistic examples?

My hope is that if the author understands why I\u2019ve made a suggestion, they\u2019ll make the change on their own next time. Sometimes, I double-check to make sure the rationale in our style guide is still valid.\\n\\nRecently, when I double-checked a style convention that I had long thought to be true, I found a bit of controversy. I had been taught that lists with more than 7-10 steps should be divided into sections with subheadings. Because cognitive psychology research showed that people can remember about 7 chunks of information at a time, many web designers concluded that menus should contain no more than 7 items, plus or minus 2. This \u201cSeven, Plus or Minus Two\u201d convention made sense in technical writing, too: excessively long to-do lists are overwhelming.\\n\\nHowever, it now seems that web designers took cognitive research too far. The research was about memory, not reading. Yes, people can remember about 7 chunks of information, but they can *read* more than that!\\n\\nWhat does this discovery mean for our style guide? Understanding the finer points of this convention will help me provide informed feedback, but I\u2019m not going to change the guide. Even refutations of the 7 plus or minus 2 rule still say that structure and hierarchy are essential. Breaking a long list into sections with subheadings remains a best practice.\\n\\n### What I\u2019m Working On\\n\\n* Advice about ordered and unordered lists\\n\\n### Question\\n\\n* How many items in a list is too many items?\\n\\n### Answers\\n\\n* Lists should contain no more than 7-10 items\\n* If a list contains more than 7-10 items, divide the list into sections with headings\\n\\n### Citations\\n\\n* [Myth #23: Choices should always be limited to 7+/-2 | UX Myths](https://uxmyths.com/post/931925744/myth-23-choices-should-always-be-limited-to-seven)\\n* [How Chunking Helps Content Processing | Nielsen Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/chunking/)\\n* [George A.
