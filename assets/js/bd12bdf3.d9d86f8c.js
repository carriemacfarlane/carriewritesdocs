If I listed the fields one after the other with no section dividers and no headings, my list would be too long to comprehend.

So I decided to break my lists into sections based on the order in which the fields appear in the form. Within each section, I would create subsections based on function.\\n\\nThis is an imperfect solution, but it\u2019s the best solution for now.
